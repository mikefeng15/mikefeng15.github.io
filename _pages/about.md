Hello! I am a third-year Economics PhD student at Vanderbilt University. My research interests lie in economic history, labor, and development economics.

I graduated with a B.S. in Quantitative Economics and International Relations from Tufts University in 2021. Prior to joining Vanderbilt, I worked as a research analyst at the Global Poverty Research Lab at Northwestern University.
